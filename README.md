## Short Description
A high-performance, scalable tool that detects and groups visually similar (“clone”) HTML documents based on how they render in a web browser.

## Long Description  
This project detects and groups visually similar HTML documents based on how they render in a headless browser, even if their source code differs slightly.  

It uses:  
- **Rust** for fast clustering logic and parallel processing (e.g., DBSCAN)  
- **Node.js + Puppeteer** for headless rendering, visible text extraction, and screenshots  
- A custom similarity engine to form "clone sets" based on visual and textual features  

In practice, many web pages look identical despite structural code differences. This solution emphasizes scalability, parallelism, and reliable data extraction to create accurate, consistent clusters of similar pages.

---

### Hybrid HTML Clustering

**Hybrid HTML Clustering Algorithm** combines text and visual analysis:

1. **Text**: Extracts TF-IDF from content (tokenization + stop-word removal) and compares with cosine similarity  
2. **Images**: Builds color histograms from screenshots and uses histogram intersection for comparison  
3. **Adaptive Clustering**: Uses an incremental threshold-based algorithm with real-time centroid updates  
4. **Parallelization**: Efficient processing of large datasets via **Rayon**  
5. **Robustness**: Error logging, data validation, and non-blocking resource management

**Unique Approach**: Smart fusion of textual semantics and visual appearance with strong focus on scalability and precision.

---

### Node.js Renderer Summary

**Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**:

1. **Parallel rendering**: Utilizes Puppeteer with a configurable pool of headless browsers  
2. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Caches requests  
   - Blocks unnecessary resources (images, CSS)  
   - Downscales resolution (800x600 @ 0.5x)  
3. **Content extraction**:
   - Captures JPEG screenshots (80% quality)  
   - Extracts clean text (excluding JS/CSS)  
4. **Resource management**:
   - Real-time progress with ETA  
   - Structured error logging  
   - File output grouped by tiers

**Rust Core Integration**:  
Prepares raw data (text + screenshots) and streams it to the clustering system.

**Scalability**:  
Capable of processing thousands of HTML files using smart parallelism and efficient resource handling.

## Technologies Used  
This project leverages a dual-language architecture to combine performance and flexibility:  

### 🦀 Rust Core  
**Why Rust?**  
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminates entire classes of bugs via ownership system  
- **Performance**: Native speed for TF-IDF/DBSCAN operations (~100x faster than Python, 10-25x faster than Node.js for compute-heavy tasks)  
- **Parallelism**: Rayon enables effortless data parallelism  

### 🌐 Node.js + Puppeteer  
**Why Node.js?**  
- **Async I/O**: Optimal for concurrent rendering tasks  
- **Ecosystem**: Rich library support (e.g., Puppeteer)  
- **Bridging**: Seamless data passing to Rust via JSON/FFI  

| Operation           | Rust (ms) | Node.js (ms) | Python (ms) |  
|---------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|  
| TF-IDF (1k docs)    | 12        | 180          | 1,200       |  
| DBSCAN (5k points)  | 48        | N/A*         | 4,800       |  
| Image Histogram     | 9         | 110          | 950         |  

_* Node.js lacks native DBSCAN implementations; Python uses scikit-learn_

## Interpretarea Rezultatelor

### Key Insights

- ✅ **Speed Scaling**: Rust version maintains >2,500 docs/sec up to 300k+ HTMLs
- ✅ **Memory Footprint**: Hybrid = 4 Chrome tabs/doc vs. Rust = <4KB/doc
- ✅ **Accuracy Balance**: Hybrid wins in pixel-diff contexts, Rust excels in semantic clones
- ✅ **I/O Load**: Rust has minimal disk & network overhead — ideal for CI pipelines
- ⚠️ **Tradeoff**: 6% drop in accuracy = **31×** throughput gain in structural clone use cases

---

## Recommended Usage by Scenario

### **Hybrid Version** (Visual + Text)
Choose this when:
- ✅ You need visual fidelity (UI validation, screenshot comparison)
- ✅ Detecting layout changes (e.g., landing page snapshots, redesigns)
- ✅ You can tolerate higher resource consumption for greater visual precision  
Avoid if:
- ❌ You're working with >10k files per run or have memory constraints

### 🦀 **Pure Rust Version** ([View Repo](https://github.com/p-savciucc/pure-html-clone-detector))
Choose this when:
- ✅ You focus on content-heavy platforms (e.g., documentation, blogs)
- ✅ You're building scalable pipelines (CI/CD, serverless, CLI tools)
- ✅ You're working on machines with constrained I/O or RAM
Avoid if:
- ❌ You require pixel-perfect visual detection

---

## Summary Takeaway

> The **Hybrid Version** offers stronger visual clone detection at the cost of performance and memory, ideal for frontend/UI-related use cases.  
> The **Rust Version** dominates in scalability, speed, and simplicity, making it the go-to for large-scale content analysis and integration in automated environments.

## Sequence Diagram
The system consists of two main components: a Node.js renderer and a Rust-based clustering engine.

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/sequence.png)

---

## Development Time
The analysis and architecture design took approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. The Node-based part required around 6 hours and 31 minutes, including optimization and more detailed output, with a final runtime of ~32 seconds. The Rust part took about 2 hours and 40 minutes, including optimization, with processing completed in roughly 1.2 seconds after the HTML rendering step. Additionally, testing with various scenarios added another 5 hours to the overall effort.

**Total**: approximately 15 hours and 41 minutes.
